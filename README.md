# OpenGLRollercoaster
An animation of a rollercoaster for CPSC 587.

# To run
From this directory, run 'make'. Then run the 'Rollercoaster' executable.
To clean, run 'make clean'.

# Notes
The dark blue part of the track is the 'ramping up' portion of the track, 
where the cart is brought up to the highest point. The light blue portion
is the 'slow down' portion, where the cart is slowed back down to min speed.

The camera rotates around the y axis according to the cart's movement, and
you can manually rotate around the x axis by clicking and draggint the mouse.
NOTE: This is not fully implemented and is a little jarring.
